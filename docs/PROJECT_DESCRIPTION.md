# Project Description

## Vision
This platform enables devotees to contribute to Cow Seva and access Temple Seva assistance, including VIP Darshan bookings, through a fast, secure, and user-friendly web experience. It unifies donation flows, booking requests, and payment processing in a single modern interface.

## Why This Solution
The client required a production-ready system that simplifies how devotees discover seva options, make secure donations, and receive assistance for temple darshan. The solution was designed to:
- Present clear, curated donation programs with fixed amounts
- Collect accurate donor information for records and acknowledgements
- Handle secure online payments with server-side controls
- Persist data reliably in a managed database

## Focus Areas
- Performance:
  - Modern frontend stack (Next.js, React)
  - Optimized UI rendering and smooth transitions
  - Minimal friction throughout the donation and booking journey
- Security:
  - Server-side Razorpay order creation and payment handling
  - Strict use of environment variables for secrets
  - Supabase service-role usage only on the server, with recommended RLS policies
- User Experience:
  - Clear donation cards and guided forms
  - Responsive layouts and motion design
  - Friendly messaging with consistent visual polish

## Professional Context
This application was developed as a freelance engagement for a client. It reflects production standards for reliability, maintainability, and data safety, with a focus on smooth user interactions and straightforward administrative workflows.
